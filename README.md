# Iris SVM Classifier

I used the iris dataset and applied SVM on it to classify the flower types.

SVM basically draws a line (or curve) that separates the classes best, it tries to keep the max distance from both sides so itâ€™s more confident about the decision. it works great when data is clearly separable.

I used train test split to divide the data and trained the model using SVC from sklearn.

It predicts flower types correctly

# My accuracy was around 0.96
